Declaration and definition are different ideas in C/C++.

For any data, in principal, it experiences the course of definition, declaration and initialization.

But in most times, declaration and definition appears at the same time.

For example: int a; finishes both declaration(tells the compiler that an integer called a would be used) and definition(allocate relevant memory for it to save data).

How can declaration separates from definition in sometimes? Here’re some situations.

1)Function defined behind the calling should be declared before it.
//form: void f(int x, int y)    (with no {})

2)variables defined in other files should be extended to the current action scope.
//form: extern int a;    (the datatype ‘int’ can be omitted)
